in this program take 1 arguemtn, 

it use fopen on the password,
then it read it's data in a buffer,
then it put a \0 in the position we input with atoi
then it read the file again in another buffer

it perform strcmp on the first buffer holding the password and our input, if there is no difference it call system("/bin/sh")

so to exploit this we will try to do ./bonus3 "" so our input just hold a "\0" and 
strcmp can only return 0

bonus3@RainFall:~$ ./bonus3 ''
$ cd ../end ; cat .pass
